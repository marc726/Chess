/**
 * Chess Pawn Promotion:
 * 
 * In chess, pawn promotion is a special rule that allows a pawn to be promoted to another piece when it reaches the opponent's back rank (8th rank for White and 1st rank for Black). This rule exists to prevent a pawn from being stuck as a pawn for the entire game and to add strategic depth to the game.
 * 
 * Restrictions:
 * - Pawn promotion occurs only when a pawn advances all the way to the opponent's back rank (8th rank for White and 1st rank for Black).
 * - The promoted piece must be a piece that was captured earlier in the game. The most common promotions are to a queen, but it's also possible to promote to a rook, knight, or bishop.
 * - The promotion is not restricted to pieces of the same color, meaning a player can have multiple queens or other promoted pieces of different colors.
 * - Pawn promotion is not mandatory. If a player chooses, they can keep a pawn on the back rank. In practice, promoting to a queen is almost always the best choice due to the queen's versatility.
 * 
 * When It Occurs:
 * - Pawn promotion can occur during a player's move when a pawn reaches the opponent's back rank.
 * - After the pawn reaches the back rank, the player can choose which piece to promote the pawn to, and the pawn is replaced by the chosen piece on the same square.
 * - The new piece can be used immediately, and it follows the rules of the promoted piece.
 * 
 * Pawn promotion adds an interesting tactical and strategic element to chess, as players must decide whether to promote a pawn, what piece to promote it to, and when to execute the promotion for maximum advantage.
